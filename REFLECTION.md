# Assignment 2 Reflection - Levi P

## Approach to the Problem 

I wrote three algorithms to create random permutations of an array. The first picks numbers randomly and checks for duplicates. The second uses a boolean array to track used numbers. The third fills the array in order and then shuffles it.

## Techniques Used 

I used random number generation, loops, and arrays. Algorithm 1 used a search to avoid duplicates. Algorithm 2 used a boolean array, and Algorithm 3 used swaps to shuffle the array.

## Challenges Encountered

I faced some difficulties while implementing the algorithms and making sure they worked correctly in all cases.

## Conclusions

Overall, I learned about different ways to approach the problem and how the methods can vary in efficiency and complexity.
